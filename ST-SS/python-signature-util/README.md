# SureThing Python Signature creation and verification library

The Python Signature Utilities library is the SureThing **reference implementation** of the location proof messages.

The library contains a module for signing and verifying claims, endorsements and verifications as general plaintext objects
and a module for keys management (generation, serialization and loading).

This library is heavily based in the [cryptography module](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/), which is in the requirements.txt.
